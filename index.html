                created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. As part of the implementation,
                Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. Nakamoto was active in the development of
                bitcoin up until December 2010.the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by
                presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in
                its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a
                decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult.

                [a] (₿) is a digital and global money system cryptocurrency. It allows people to send or receive money
                across the internet, even to someone they don't know or don't trust. It is the first of its kind
                technology that allows the transfer of digital scarcity across the internet without needing a third
                party. Money can be exchanged without being linked to a real identity. The mathematical field of
                cryptography is the basis for Bitcoin's security.Bitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual
                currency or a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely virtual.

                It's like an online version of cash. You can use it to buy products and services, but not many shops
                accept Bitcoin yet and some countries have banned it altogether.</p>
